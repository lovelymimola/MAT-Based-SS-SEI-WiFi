This is code of MAT-based SS-SEI for WiFi dataset.

The dataset can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1aah2mh9sJvtXs6XjKkxLZQ and password is biv8. 

We randomly select 3,080 samples from the original dataset (only 62 step) for simulation, and selection approach can be seen from the code Dataset/SplitData.py.
